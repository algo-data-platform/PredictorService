// We support multiple strategies for HTTP2 communication.  Each
// strategy has an associated version id, the greater the value of the
// version id, the more preferred it is.  The base strategy is the
// legacy approach - that the previous implementations support.  This
// is assigned version 1.  We use the HTTP2 SETTINGS frame exchanged
// during connection setup to handshake on the channel version for the
// connection.
//
// Both the client and the server send the maximum version it can
// handle in its SETTINGS frame to the other side
// (kMaxSupportedChannelVersion).
// proxygen::SettingsId::THRIFT_CHANNEL_ID is used as the SETTINGS id to
// send this version number.
//
// When the SETTINGS frame is received, the lesser of the maximum
// version values of the client and server is chosen as the negotiated
// version.  If the SETTINGS frame does not contain the maximum
// version number, it is assumed to be a legacy implementation and
// version 1 is assumed for this case.
//
// On the server side, the negotiated version is determined before it
// receives the first RPC.  However, on the client side, it may send
// RPCs to the server before it determines the negotiated version.
// These RPCs are sent using version number 1.  This version number is
// also included as a HTTP2 header with key kChannelVersionKey.
// Legacy clients will send version 1 RPCs also, but without the HTTP2
// header.
//
// The client moves to the negotiated version immediately after
// negotiation and includes the negotiated version in the HTTP2 header
// (with key kChannelVersionKey).  The client stops including the
// negotiated version in the header after it receives a response from
// the server for a RPC sent using the negotiated version.  On the
// server side, once it receives the first RPC with the negotiated
// version, it registers the stream id for this RPC and assumes that
// all future RPCs (with greater stream ids) will be performed using
// the negotiated version.  It does not inspect the header for these
// future RPCs.
//
// If the flag "force_channel_version" is set to a positive value,
// that version is used for all RPCs and the HTTP2 header is not
// set/inspected.
